Business Plan: CollabConnect
Tagline: Where Influence Meets Opportunity
Executive Summary
CollabConnect is a subscription-based platform that connects small businesses and
multi-location brands with local social media influencers. Focused on simplicity and
authenticity, it removes barriers to influencer marketing by eliminating commission models
and instead offering a flat monthly or annual fee. With unlimited campaigns, smart
matchmaking, and tools tailored to the needs of both businesses and creators,
CollabConnect aims to become the leading collaboration marketplace for localized
influencer partnerships.
